4 2 OCTAVIUS

sententiouffliess, the love os paradox and satiric verve of
his style point to an appreciation and study of Seneca
(eg. 12. 63 5. 9} 7.1; 8. 1; 9. 53 24. 18, etc). In
the second part of the Dialogue especially, where Stoic
doctrine is quoted in defence of Christianity‚ the
influence of Seneca is manifest.¹

The iufiuence of the older classics, of Cicero especially,
is also discernible. Even in his own age, we know, the
superiority of Fronto was not unquestioned. Marcus
Aurelius, his favourite pupil, rejected Latin in favour of
Greek as a medium of composition*2 Minucius, perhaps,
was a pioneer of neo-Ciceronianism. The well-balanced
rhythmical period and choice of metrical clauses,
characteristic of Cicero's best polemio style, are observ-
able in the Octavius. The favourite Ciceronian figures of
asyndeton3 (2. 1; 4. 1; 5. 8; 12. 73 19. 23 16. 53
17. 4: 11. 3, etc.); praeteritio (13. 43 17. 7; 18. 2;
22. 73 23. 5, eto), and inversion (eg. resedit interitio
1. 53 reversaret praesentia 2. 23 animal omne 5. 83 cor-
poribus quibus 11. 73 in illo praecipue sermone 1. 53
investigandae penitus veritatis 5. 9 ; cf. 4. ὃς 7. 3; 9. 1 ;
13. 33 3. 43 40. 2, etc.) frequently recur.

A symmetrical arrangement of words and phrases is
one of the most distinctive characteristics of the style
of Minucius. Syntax and even sense are ..sometimes
sacrificed to symmetry (eg. obiuryavit neqleyentiae to
correspond with argueret inscientiae 4. 33 exploratio divina
to correspond with humana mediocritas 5. 53 de diis
spolia with de gentibus tropaea 25. 63 ozee morte finitur
with dolore deseritur 37. 33 in hiberno with in saeculo
34. 11, etc). But Minucius studies variety also, either
