CHAPTER XXXIV

g 1. umorem deficere: there is evidently a lacuna in P here.
The burning of the world is possible in two ways: either by fire
falling from heaven or by the waters of the earth becoming ex-
hausted (ἓ 2). Read. of P is aut improvisum iynem cadere aut difficile.
Waltzing after Norden reads deficere umorem, taking difficile as a
corruption of deficere. Our suggestion is that the scribe’s mistake
arose owing to the similarity between cadere aut and deficere haud
(haud being often written haut). Cf. linquam defecerat umor (Ov.
M. 9. 567); Verg. G. 1. 290. Tr. : “ Concerning the conflagration
of the world, there is no difficulty (sc. est) in either fire suddenly
falling 01· moisture failing.''

vulgaris erroris ε i.e. a, mistake of which philosophers are
incapable.

§2 caelum . . . abiturum: after coepisse the read. of P is:
desinere fontium dulcis aqua maria. Our suggestion is that si
dropped out after coepisse and that desinere is a corruption of
desinerent. This gives excellent sense and does least violence to
the MSS. The Stoic theory was that the sun, moon and stars
being made of fire required to be nourished or fed: sunt stellae
natura flammeae: quocirca terrae, maris, aquarum vaporibus aluntur
iis, qui a sole em ayo-is tepefactis et ex aquis concitantur . . . Em quo
eventurum nostri putant . . . utad earm-emam omnis mundus iynesccret
cum humore consumpto, neque terra ali posset neque remearet a'e'r, cuius
ortus aqua omni exhausta esse posset (Cic. N. D. 2. 46 ; cf. ibid. 3. 14).
For the present these flames are being fed by the vapours aseending
from the waters of the earth and sea, but if at any time these waters
should fail‚theheavens would end in fire (in vimiynis abiturum)as they
began (ita ut coepisse) and consume everything. Cf. deus in flammas
abiit (Ov. Μ. 1. 495). Coepisse : infin. by attract. to abiturum sc. esse.

Waltzing places a full stop after desinere of P and then inserts
omnem adeo mundum, si solem, lunam, reliqua astra desierit, finishing the
sent. at iynescat. For mariahe reads et aqua marinawahlen). Holden
