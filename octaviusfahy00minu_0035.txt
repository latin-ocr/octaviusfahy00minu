INTRODUCTION 1 9

had held the Christian religion up to ridicule.1 Lovers
of Cicero, too, could not fail to have been attracted by
the resemblance of the work of Minucius to the discourse
οη the Nature of tlte θοάς. They would have recognised
in Caecilius the counterpart of Cotta, and as Cotta
represented the religione views of Cicero himself, the
conversion of Caecilius to Christianity might be inter-
preted as an earnest of the conversion of Cicero, if only
the great orator had lived to hear the arguments of
Octavius.2 And what a commendation this for the
new religion Ξ

The- Octavius belonged to a class of apologetic
literature that did not command the approbation of
Tertullian. He lacked sympathy with the school of
Christian writers who emphasised the harmony of
Christianity with previous philosophic thought, regard-
ing it as the last stage in the evolution, the final and
perfect accomplishment. That violent vindicator of the
new saith rejected anything that savoured of compromise.
Athens for Tertullian had no kinship with Jerusalem
nor the Academy with the Church. He is not at pains
to extol the old civilisation or minimise the transition.
His appeal is to Roman law, not to reason, good sense or
humanity.3 Both schools of thought are still existent
and active in many spheres of life and the justice of
their claims is not lightly decided. According to one
modern critic, however, the one little dialogue of
Minucius has done as much service to the cause of
religion as the combined volumes of his African
contemporary.
