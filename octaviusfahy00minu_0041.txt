INTRODUCTION 25

second century of the Christian era Greek was the
literary language of Rome, and its popularity and ex-
tensive use necessarily affected the Latin language and
idiom. Greek words and constructions crept in and
became unconsciously part of the ordinary speech of the
Romans.

Another revolutionising force was the influence of the
provinces. Colonists as a rule came from the lower
classes at Rome,—-soldiers, merchants, and adventurers3
and their language imperfect in itself, the plebeius sermo
of the Submra, became still further corrupted by contact
with the indigenous idioms of their adopted country.
Gaul, Spain, Africa, and Italy made their influence felt
in the language of their conquerors. In Africa especially
contact with the native Libyan and Punic dialects so
transformed the Latin language that Apuleius found it
necessary to relearn it to make himself understood in
the Roman capital.¹ A multiplicatiori of composite and
derivative words, a tendency to reduce all substantives
and verbs to a single type of flexion‚ a preference for
the analytica] rather than the synthetical orden—these
were some of the commoner features of provincial Latin.2

The spread of Christianity in the second century was
the most potent revolutionising force in Roman civilisa-
tion and institutions. Christianity entailed an alteration
of ideals and values. Unlike philosophy its influence
affected all classes of the community. A whole host of
new conceptions demanded a further remoulding of the
language. More particularly, the Roman mind was
accustomed to speculation‚ and the taste for abstract
expression was developed.
