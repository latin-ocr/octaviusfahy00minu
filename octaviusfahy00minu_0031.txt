INTRODUCTION 15

for the pagan mind, which Minucius is anxious at this
¹ stage to purge from all carnal notions concerning divinity.
The reflection, too> that a god could have been executed
as a criminal would have proved a stumbling-block and
a scandal to a people who associated true divinity with
power and victory. Such is the recorded experience of
St. Paul.1 The disasters of the Jewish nation bred
contempt for their God in the minds of the Romans ² and
the God of the Christians is condemned as a weakling
for abandoning his subjects to a fate of poverty and
death.·⁹' The knowledge at this stage that this God
himself had perished at the hands of his subjects would
have determined the pagan once and for all against a
religion that professed such a dogma.

It is a remarkable fact that the Passion of Christ,
which afterwards became the dominant theme of Christian
art, is not represented in the paintings of the Catacombs;
and it is particularly worthy of note that no picture of
the Crucifixion appears before the seventh century.4 These
were concessions to pagan prejudice which lingered in
the people's mind long aster the downfall of paganism
itself.

The details of cult, which according to a universal
tendency paganism ranked first in its religion with fatal
consequences, are omitted by Minucius as a matter of
secondary import. True notions of the Godhead rather
than of the way of worship are of primary significance.⁵
“ As for the main point of the inquiry‚'' says Caecilius at
the end, “ I admit the case concerning providence and I
yield as regards God.” ⁶
