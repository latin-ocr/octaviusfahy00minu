omnium et omnium domiuum} His respect for the
philosophers, too, has apparently lessened. Having
quoted them with seeming approval and referred to the
doctrine of Plato as divine,2 he now calls Socrates an
“Attic buffoon,”3 and his followers corrupt debauchees
who cannot raise their voice against wickedness without
reprimanding themselves} The clouds of prejudice, it
is to be assumed, were considered dispelled at this stage,
and there was occasion for more candid speech.

Another purpose which the Octavius served was to
disabuse the educated pagan public of the notion that
obscurantism was essentially connected with Christianity.
Previously to the third century the converts to the new
creed belonged for the most part to the lower orders of
society. Slaves, freedmen, and artisans, scarcely to be
accounted men according to old Roman standards, were
among its earliest adherents. There was much poverty
and little learning in the Christian community at this
time, as the inscriptions in the catacombs show. Hence
to the wealthy and educated classes the acceptance of
this religious system seemed to entail an absolute break
with the traditions of Roman civilisation, a rejection for
evermore of philosophy and letters, of the theatre and
circus, of everything, in fact, that made life worth living. ⁵
Now the very form of the Octavius and apparently
incidental circumstances in the plot were calculated to
correct this prevalent notion. The case for paganism is
put with such admirable na'ivete that some critics think
it a mere reproduetion of an actual invective against
Christianity. The claims of friendship are respected
without regard to religious persuasion3 the Christians
are accompanied by a pagan on their holiday excursion
