INTRODUCTION 7

placing Tertullian first by precedence of merit as an
apologist. Now the Apoloqeticus of Tertullian appeared
about the year 197, and we know that the work of
Minucius preceded the De Idolorum Vanitate of Cyprian
(circ. 245), for the influence of the Octavius is here
unmistakably apparent, so that even accepting the
priority of Tertullian's work we can assign the first half
of the third century, at the latest, as the period in which
our author fiourished. The ,Weight of authority, however,
in recent times is in favour of ascribing the composition
of the Octavius to the second half of the second century,
about the year 187.1 Fronto of Cirta died about the
year 17 5, and judging from the references in the Dia.logue‘·'
Fronto was probably still living at the date of composition,
or at least a well-known personality. It is pmbable,
indeed, that the Octavius was a reply to a speech delivered
by him in the senate, in which the current calumnies
against Christianity were repeated33 and, in that case,
Minucius must have written while Fronto's attack was
still fresh in the public memory. A study of the language
of the Octavius, also, it is thought, confirms the view that
Minucius belonged to the epoch of Fronto}

There is no allusion in the Dialogue to the reigning
emperor or the political events of the time that might
give a clue to the date of composition. The references
to the Parthians,5 the Jews,6 joint rulership ⁷ and Vesuviusss
are without value in this connexion. It appears, how-
ever, that Christianity was still very largely confined to
the poor and ignorant and that the influx of the lettered
and wealthy classes, ascribed to the beginning of the third
century, had not yet taken place. Apparently, too, a
