any god outside the material universe. Cf. omnem vim dii-inam in

Epicurus: 342-270 B.C. Owing to the universality of belief
in the gods, Epicurus did not deny their existence, but maintained
they had no concern for the world: verbis reliquit deos, re sustulit
(Cio. ibid. 1. 30. 85). He regarded Nature as a blind unconscious
force governing the movement of atoms. Cf. Tert. Apol. 47. 6.

ξ 9. Aristoteles ε 384-322 13.0.‚ disciple of Plato and founder of
the Peripatetics. He believed in the existence of one supreme “ Un—
moved Mover‚’' a supreme self-conscious intelligenee (mentem) ; the
notion of divine pemonality, however, finds no place in his system.

He varies (variat) inasmuch as at the outset he regards the
Platonic “separate forms ’' as empty names, considering the
individual existing thing as a composite of matter and a form
which only exists in mantem while in the end he maim-ains the
existence of a being of pure form, which imbues matter with form
and is itself the prime mover (see Taylor, Aristone, p. 51). Cf.
‘modo enim menti· tribuit omnem divinitatem, modo mundum ipsum
[lemn dicit esse; modo quemdam alium praeficit mundo (Cic. ibid.
1. 13. 33) ; Plut. Flac. Phil. 7 3 Lact. Div. Inst. 5. 22.

mundo alias ‘menti divinae tribuens principatum heracleides ponticus
qaoque de cleo divinam mentem quamvis varie adscribit (adscribendo
written above) theophrastus et Zenon, etc. To me it appears that
Aristoles before Ponticas was orig. a marg. gloss (denoting subject
of praeficit, see text) that crept into the text3 and Heracleides
ponticus after principatum appears to have been a marg. gloss
explan. of Ponticus. This is the well-known philosopher
Heracleides of Heraclea in Pontus. Of. Ponticas Heracleictes modo
