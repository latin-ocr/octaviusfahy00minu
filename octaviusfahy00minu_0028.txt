1 2 OCTAVIUS

the period of Minucius. On what other hypothesis,
then, than as suggested is the paradox explained 2

Now, against the theory that Minucius was a heretic

him in the sorefront of the defenders of Christianity.l
The encomium of the former is especially noteworthy.
He expresses a regret that Minucius had not devoted
himself entirely to apologetics, such an earnest of success

fect instruction is just as improbable as unorthodoxy.
Moreover, assuming the discussion was an historica] fact,
we know that Minucius had accepted Christianity
previously to it,—he is described at this time as one

too, seems to have elapsed between the discussion and
the date of writing: Octavius had died in the meantime.4
So that, in all probability, Minucius was no longer in the
neophyte stage. Another explanation must be sought.

Minucius Felix was not a Christian by birth. He
