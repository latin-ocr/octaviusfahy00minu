NOTES 113

caelo: in omitted; Introd. vi. O 25.

scire. . . religiosum : the read. of P is ut scrutare, due perhaps
to a careless copyist who construed the words with datum. WValtz-
ing reads aut scire sit datum aut ruspari reliyiosum (Norden). For
the act. form scrutare inst. of the deponent see Prisc 799. There
was a tendeucy in later writers to use such forms. Introd. vi. Β
6. Stuprari has been unnecessarily questioned (other emends. are
suspicari, lustrare, interpretari). In 12. 7 Caecilius says, Proinde
siquid sapientiae vobis aut verecundiae est desinite caeli plagas et
mundi fata et secreta rimari. Prying into such things was an out-
rage against modesty according to Caecilius.

oraculum: γνῶθι σεαυτόν, the maxim inscribed on the temple
at Delphi.

ξ 6. quatenus=qa0niam3 arch. and poet. (Lucu, Hor„ Ov.); cf.
Tac. A. 3. 16. 14.

indulgentes . . . labori : cf. et sano iuvat indul-qm labori (Verg.
Α. 6. 135).

ultra.. ‚terminosz cf. ultra 1 terminum curis vagor expeditis
(Hor. Od. 1. 22. 10).

proiecti, “ cast forth‚'’ with idea of being exiled3 cf. Cic. Cat.
2. 1. 2 ; Tac. A. 1. 3. 9; Ezek. 16. 5.

caelum transcendimus: cf. caelum ipsum petimus stultitia
(Hor. Otl. 1. 3. 38).

vel hunc, ete„ “this error bad as it is '²3 for vel as intensive
part. cf. sed tamen vel regnum malo quam liberum populum (Cic. Rep.
3.34.46)

ξ 7. sint, “ suppose the existence of.’'

semina, . . . densata, “ a conglomeration of atoms resulting from
the sels-fertilisation of nature.'' According to the atomio theory of
Leucippus, Democritus, Epicurus and Lucretius there were two
things in existence from all eternity‚ infinite space and atoms.
Moving about in space these atoms clashed together by chance and
combined to form the various objects in existence (nulla coqente
natura sed concursu quodam fortuito, Cic. N.D. l. 66), the lighter
atoms ascending and forming the heavens, the heavier forming the
earth (Lucr. 5. 417-510). Hence the external intervention of a
creator is unnecessary. The idea of a sels-fertilising nature pro-
ducing a combination of atoms is foreign to the Epicurean system ;
cf. Lact. viv. Inst. 4. 8. 4 ; Aug. Civ. Dei, 7. 9. The nature which
has produced the world according to Epicurus (docuit nos natura
effectum esse mandam, Cic. N.D. 1. 53) is merely the blind, uncon-
scious force or chance that presided over the combinatione of atoms
