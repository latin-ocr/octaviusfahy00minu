132 OCTAVIUS

of society‚'' who formed a great part of the Christian community.
Cf. mitto hasce artes vulgares, C(›qu05‚ pistores, lecticarios (Cic. R. Am.
46. 134). 11 seems more likely that pistorum is a corruption of
piselo‘rum written in the MS. as a contract. for pisciculorum.
Christiane were referred to as pisciculi (Tert. Bapt. 1) from their
use of the fish symbol,——adopted‚ as later writers maintain, because
the Gk. word ἰχθῦς contains the initials of Ἰησοῦς Χριστὸς
Θεοῦ Υἱὸς Σωτήρ. — The terni pisciculi, however, had an
opprobrious signification. See Suet. Tz'b. 44, where 11 is applied
to 1116 innocent victims of Tiberius's lust. The corruption into
pistorum might have easily occurred, as the contractiori mark
(piaclorum) over the cl may have misled a copyist. Gronovius
suggested iurisconsultorum, in contr. form IC lorum. Schone reads
patronus iecorum (Γ. istorum of origin).
