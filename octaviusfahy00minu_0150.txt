inconsistency of the argument of Caecilius are due to cunning
pleatling‚——w'ith the object of damaging the reply 3 or whether the
fault lies with the salsity (errorem) of his convictions. In deferenee
to Caecilius, he immediately preeludes the first alternative. Other
emends. are vafritia (Haupt, Waltzing)‚ versutia (Vahlen).
