Signa repetamus: the pres. subj. after the histor. tense is
thought to give a clue to the date of composition of the Octavius.
In 161 ΑΛ). Vologeses III. of Parthia massacred an entire Roman
army at Elegeia in Armenia. This disaster was avenged in the
following year by the Emperor Verus. If Minucius wrote previ-
ously to, or during, the latter campaign, the tense of repetamus is
regular. Verus, however, could not be said to demand back the
standards lost at Carrhae. Augustus had recovered these by
diplomacy in 20 ΒΕ. (111072. Ancyr. 29). But if the Romans
recovered the standards, they had never wiped out the disgrace
inflicted on the prestige of Rome by the defeat at Carrhae. Thus,
perhaps, the present tense can be explained z “ Crassus despised the
auguries and as a result we have still the Parthian question.⁷’
(See D'Alton, Horace cmd his Aye, pp. 13-2 2.) Cf. Hor. Od. 3. 6. 9 ;
Vell. 2. 46. lValtzing thinks the pres. is retained for the sake of
the metrical ending — υ υ Ι υ - υ. Schone reads repeteremus
(Halm). Repetere with double accus. on analogy of reposcere is
irreg. ; cf. Parthosque reposcere siqua (Verg. A. 7. 606). Introd. vi.
