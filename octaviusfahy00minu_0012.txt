vi OCTAVIUS

Minucius Felix is to help to remedy the abuse we refer
to, by focusing attention once more on this gem of
Christian literature. Minucius was probably the first of
the Latin apologists of Christianity, and a study of his
work is a most fitting introduction to the Latin Christian
classics. While continental scholars have been busfly
engaged in the elucidation of this author no English
edition has appeared since the middle of the nineteenth
century. The work of Holden will always command the
respect of scholars, but scholarship has advanced since
his day, and the very difficulty of procuring a copy of his
work is sufficient apology for an independent edition.

The text is based on the collation of VValtzing
(Louvain 1909), the instances in which Ι have departed
from his readings being noted in the commentary (3. 3 3

(Leipzig 1913) suffers so much from arbitrary emendation
of the original that, with one or two notable exceptions,
it seems to me of little value. The orthography of the
Paris MS. is said to be faulty and capricious hence I
have adopted the ordinary spelling in almost every
instance, using assimilation instead of dissimilation,
although it· is practically certain that Minucius wrote
adyralior for aggredior, inberbis for imberbis, adflatus for
afflatus etc.‚ and for archaic effect locuntur (9. 6), inicum
(28. 1), delitisco (27. 1)‚faci¹nerosas (25. 2), loquela (2. 1),
eto„ instead of the familiar forms.
