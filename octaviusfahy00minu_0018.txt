2 OCTAVIUS

to the quick by this gratuitous insult to his religion and
challenged Octavius to a formal (lebate. The Christian
accepted, and forthwith the three friends take a seat on
the mole of Ostia with Minucius in the centre as arbiter.

The dialogue proper begins at Chapter V. The speech
of Caecilius, the champion of paganism, covers nine
chapters (VQXIII), while the reply of Octavius for
Christianity extends to twenty-three chapters (XVI-
XXXVIII), the intervening chapters (XIV—XV) consisting of
a few more or less irrelevant remarks by Minucius on
the general question of (lebate. A short epilogue con-
cludes (XXXIX—XL).

The arguments of Caecilius are mainly as follows :—-

1. Truth is impossible of attainment. Hence scepti-
cism is the only sensible attitude. The evidence that
exists points to an absence of divine providence in the
government of the world.

2. It is a holier and a better thing to adhere to the
ancient religion whose efficacy has been proved. The
ancient gods give ample proof of their existence, and
shower blessings on the people.

3. Christians are a contemptible set of ignoramuses
drawn from the dregs of society. Their religion is im-
moral and absurd. Their god is an impotent, inquisitive
individual, and their life a cheerless round of dull existence.

4. Secrecy is the chief feature of Christian worship.
Rumour has it that they adore a criminal and the gibbet
on which he was crucified, as well as an ass’s head.
Their theories about the world’s end, a future life, reward
and punishment are ludicrously foolish.

Octavius deals with these arguments one by one. He
notes the inconsistency of Caecilius, who first professed
saith in scepticism and in the next breath championed
