period is being treated when the new-born Church was
free from violent persecution, although subjected to the
misrepresentation which was the lot of every unpopular
political and religious institution.1 Minucius and Octavius
make no secret of their profession of Christianity and are
equally candid in their denunciation of the State religion.
The Apoloqcticus, on the contrary, reveals different circum-
stances that point to a later period when Christianity
was more extended and the government had adopted the
device of diverting public attention, in times of crisis, to
the illegal Christian associations whose superstitious
practices, they alleged, incurred the wrath of heaven on
the State. In the Octavius, it is to be noted, Christians
are reproachfully accused of refusing office and honours,2
but the charge of being public enemies and being re-
sponsible for national disasters is not yet preferred against
them, while Tertullian, on the other hand, is at pains to
absolve his co-religionists from such accusations.3 The
inference is that Minucius wrote at a period of compara-
tive freedom from persecution‚ when the empire was still
prosperous‚—at some time within the reigns of Marcus
Aurelius (161-180) and Commodus (HG-192), before
the calamities that followed the civil wars between
Septimius Severus and his rivals (193).

Those who advocate the earlier productiori of the
Apoloqetz‘cus4 emphasise the points of resemblance between
the two works, the similarity of subject matter, ideas,
arguments and even words, but maintain that there is an
originality in Tertullian’s manner of treatment which
argues that he was first in the field. A close comparison
