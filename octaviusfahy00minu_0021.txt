INTRODUCTION 5

apologists are discussed, Tertullian is mentioned first, the
Apoloyeticus and Contra Gentes getting a special meed of
praise; Minucius Felix, a lawyer of the Roman bar, is
mentioned next, and the works Octavius and De Fato are
complimented, with a doubt, however, expressed as to the
authenticity of the latter (εἰ tamen inscriptio ozon mentitur
auctorem). References to Arnobius, Lactantius, Victorinus
Martyr, Cyprian, Hilary and Juvencus follow in order.1
In the Epistle to Heliodorus several Latin apologists are
mentioned in the following order: Tertullian, Cyprian,
Hilary, Minucius Felix, Victorinus and ΑΙῊΟῙΟῙΠΞ.2 And
in another epistle Jerome, speaking of the Latin writers,
places Tertullian still first, followed in order by Cyprian,
Minucius, Lactantius, and Hilary.3 In a reference in the
Commentary on Isaiah to Christian writers of taste and
eloquence Tertullian is again first, followed by Cyprian,
Minucius, and others}

St. Eucher (circ. 425), in an Epistle to Valerianus,
enumerating the apologists most renowned for eloquence,
mentions Lactantius, Minucius, Cyprian, Hilary, John,
and Ambrose.⁵

Thus, all we know for certain is that Minucius Felix
was an advocate of the Roman courts and author of the
Octavius. His exact dates and birth-place are matters of
conjecture. He is generally believed to have been an
African. Ianuarius Octavius, his bosom friend, the
champion of Christianity in the Dialogue, was probably
an African also3 while Caecilius Natalis, the spokesman
of paganism, was a Numidian from Cirta. Inscriptions
concerning a Minucius Felix have been found, one at
