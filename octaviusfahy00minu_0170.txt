154 OCTAVIUS

non = nonne; cf. Cic. Verr. 2. 4. 23.

profanus, “ impious'' ; poet., 8. 3.

exta demessa: Gelenius proposes testa, taking obscena as
subst.; cf. Samia tesia Galli . . . virilitatem amputare (Pliny 35. 165).

male sanos: to be taken predicatively. In full the sent. would
run: male sanos . . . esse quiin ista desipiant. Cf. Sen. Super-stit.
ap. Aug. Giv. Dei, 6. 10.

in ista: iu with accus. denoting result of action of verb ; ef.
deniqne in familiae luctum atque in privignorum fimus nupsit (Cic.
Clu. 66. iss).

turbam . . . patrocinia: cf. insanitatis patrocinium insanien-
tium turba (Son. ap. Aug. G'iv. Dei, 6. 10) ; defendit numerus (J uv.
S. 2. 46).

ἕ 10. et aspicis. . . tumulum: in P this sentence occurs (et
despicis P) after Iovis yeiztem c. 21. 3, and is followed by chaps.
23, 24. VValtzing considers this sent. an interpolation. Chap. 22
seems to be naturally ended at multitudo 3 but, on the other hand,
there is a contrast drawn between the prescribed ritual (ritus
22. 8) of the various cults and the eults themselves (23. l). The
sistrum, scattered limbs, and empty tomb are the symbolio things
connected with the worship of Isis, just as the barefooted priests
with the worship of Pan, the Salii with that of Mars, or the Galli
with that of Cybele. Hence, if this passage is genuine, its natural
place is the section dealing with the ritus. Several edd. correct it
and include it in c. 23. Vahlen reads desipias (“you may rave
about ”) and inserts it after sacra Romana (23. 2) ; Ausserer, et
despice, and inserts it after miserorum (leorum3 Schone, en aspice
Isidis sacrorum ordinem .· sistram cietur ad inanem sui Serapidis sive
Osiris tantulum after miserorum deorum.

Isidis ad hirundinem, “ Isis of the swallow form ’' ; ad = Gk.
κατά, “answering to the description of,²’ eg. κατὰ Μιθραδάτην
(Herod. 1. 121) 3 κατὰ πνιγέα (Ar. Av. 1001). Cf. ad naves
(Lucr. 4. 897), “like ships '’ (read. rejected, however, by Munro
in 3rd edit. ). Plutarch speaks of the conversion of Isis into
a swallow z αὐτὴν ''Io-iod γενομένην χελιδόνα τῇ κίονι περι-
πέτεσθαι aaz θρηνεῖν (Isid. et Osir. 357 C).
