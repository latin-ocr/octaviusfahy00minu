16 OCTAVIUS

Nor is the silence of the Octavius regarding the
Scriptures due to ignorance or unbelief, but to the con-
sciousness, rather, that their authority was of no avail
beside that of the pagan masters. Minucius speaks to
his readers in language they can understand.1 Where the
word of Matthew‚ John, or Paul would have fallen short,
that of Plato, Cicero, or Seneca was sure to find its mark.
Minucius quotes the pagan philosophers to prove the
existence and unity of a supreme divine power,2 to show
that Christianity has a true philosophie basis, that it is in
genuine succession from Thales, the founder of philosophy.
Out of the mouth os paganism paganism is resuted and
Christianity is justified? Hence at the conclusion of an
argument it is triumphantly stated: “ I have expounded
the views of almost all the more renowned philosophers . . .
so that anyone would think that either now Christians
are philosophers or that philosophers even then were
Christians.’'4 And again: “But it is sufficient for our
purpose that even in this matter your philosophers in
some sort agree with us.” ⁵ Christianity, in other words,
is of a piece with the most ancient philosophy.

Minucius, therefore, administers his knowledge spar-
ingly, not that his instruction was defective but because
the treatment of the case demanded slight draughts. He
supplies the milk rather than the solid food of Christian
doctrine. His reticence and reserve are tactica13 and it
is to be noted that towards the end of the debate, when
the assent of Caecilius is being gained, the language is
less restrained and abstract. At an earlier stage he
deprecates the applying to God of those useless names of
F ather, King, or Master,⁶ but now he styles him parentem
