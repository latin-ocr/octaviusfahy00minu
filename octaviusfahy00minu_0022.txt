6 OCTAVIUS

Tebessa1 and another at Cartliage.2 The Carthaginian
schools of rhetoric enjoyed a far-reaching fame at this
time,3 and after a thorough education there the brilliant
Minucius may have been attracted to Rome by the
prospects of a forensic career. There the African Fronto
had already risen to the pinnacle of fame, and thither
also at a later period St. Augustine repaired.

(b) Date of the “ Octavius ''

Most of the latter-day critics agree. that Minucius was
a contemporary of Tertullian3 whether a younger or
older contemporary is not d‘ecided. There is no likeli-
hood in the theory that our author’s activity lay in the
reign of Antoninus Pius (138-161), and equally un-
· tenable is the position that Minucius belonged to the
early part of the fourth century.4 More perplexed‚ how-
ever, is the question os the relative dates of productiori
of the Octavius and Apoloyetz'cus: whether Tertullian was
the model and Minucius the imitator‚—for the resem-
blance is apparent—or vice versa. The hypothesis of a
third source common to both, but no longer discoverable,
lacks probability. Lactantius, in the passage quoted
above, gives Minucius priority to Tertullian, and some
maintain that this is the chronological order. Jerome, on
the other hand, always places Tertullian first, but it is to be
noted that, beyond this, Jerome observes no regular order
in his enumeration of Christian writers. Minucius is once
second, twice third coming after Cyprian, and once fourth
coming after the fourth-century Hilary. It is not un-
likely, therefore, that Jerome disregards chronology‚
