14 OCTAVIUS

sceptical about other divinity ¹ ; and again he is confident
of the gods' existence and of their interest in humanity.
“ They give hope to the downcast‚” he argues in a fervour
of devotion, “help to the needy‚ consolation in affliction,
alleviation in toil.'' ² But he has never, it is plain,
devoted deep thought to the question. Inquiry into
matters that have baffled the ingenuity of philosophers
he considers futile sor the ordinary individual‚ resulting,
as it well may, in the destruction of all religion. Quae
sunt dubia, ut sunt, relinquenda sunt ³ is his motto.

The purpose of Minucius, then, is to induce his pagan
readers of the class represented by Caecilius to investigate
for themselves, trusting to their own resources4 instead
of blindly following tradition. Such investigation, says
Octavius, is in accordance with man’s very nature, and
not the exclusive privilege of any class.⁵ The spirit of
inquiry once aroused, Minucius felt that sympathy and
conviction would follow, as in the case of Caecilius. The
Octavius, in other words, was intended as an introduction
to Christianity, a prolegomenon, rather than as a scientific
apology or exhaustive exposition of the Christian religion.
If Minucius can demonstrate that Christianity is a
rational religion and, as such, has many points in common
with ancient philosophy, his object is attained. It was,
indeed, difficult for one who had been nurtured in pagan
mythology with its highly specialised divhmities, where
almost every function of life had a deity corresponding,
to conceive the existence of an one and only God capable
of supervising to the smallest detail the whole universe.
Hence the infinite majesty, the greatness and unity of
God are insisted upon.6 The name of Christ is not
mentioned, because sonship had only one connotation
