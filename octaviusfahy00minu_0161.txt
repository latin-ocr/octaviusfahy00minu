NOTES 145

mundum, tum mentem divinam esse putat (Cic. ibid. 1. 34). Before
quoque some such word as constat seems to have'been corrupted.
The similarity of letters in Ponticus might account for this. Cf.
nec vero Theophrasti inconstantia ferenda est: modo enim menti
divinum tribuit principatum, modo eaelo, tum cerotem siynis
sideribusque caelestibus (Cic. ibid. 1. 35). The omission of a
finite verb constat would also account for the corruption of the
gerund ascribendo to ascribit.

Theophrastus (circ. 363-278 EC.) was the favourite pupil of
Aristotle and his successor as president of the Lyceum.

Waltzing after Medan reads: Theophrastus etiam variat, alias
mundo, alias menti divinae tribuens principatum. Heraclides
Ponticus quoque mando divinam mentem, quamvis varie, adscribit.

ἓ 10. Zenon, etc: Zeno (circ. 336-265 B.C.) was founder of
the Stoics. This school held that everything consisted of matter,
which in turn consisted of an active and a passive element‚ the.
former being the moving force of the latter and the single, all-
pervading soul of the world. Cf. Zeno naturalem legem divinam
esse censet ,· eamque vim obtinere recta imperantem, prohibentemque
contraria (Cic. ibid. l. 14). Cleanthes (circ. 300-220 Rc.) was a
pupil of Zeno and his successor as head of the Porch3 he wrote a
hymn to Zeus, still extant. Chrysippus (circ. 280-207 Rc.) was
a disciple of Cleanthes; by maintaining the possibility of attaining
knowledge he won great support for the doctrines of Stoicism, of
which he was sometimes called the second founder.

multiformes: the Stoies also vary in the details of their
teaching. Cf. atque alio loco (Zenon) aethera deum esse dicit (Cic.
ibid. 1. 35) ; Chrysippus . . . ait vim divinam in ratione esse positam,
et in universae naturae animo atque mente, ipsumque mundum deum
dicit esse. . . tum fatalem vim et necessitatem rerum futurarum, iqnem
praeterea et . . . aethera (iet, ibid. 1. 39) ; Cleanthes tum ipsum mnndum
deum dicit esse, tum totins naturae menti atque animo tribuit hoc
nomen, tum ardorem qui aether nominetur, certissimum deum iudicat
(id, ibid. 1. 14); Lact. Div. Inst. 5. 19; Diog. Laert. 7. 135 ;
Tert. Ad Ilffare. 1. 13.

providentiae: 18. 5.

mentem...animum: after Cic. ibid. 1. 35 (quoted supra).
liffentem modo <mimum is read. of P.

plerumque, “often'' ; 14. 3.

disserit: Davies for disseruit of P. The present gives the
double cretio ending. Introd. vi. F 3 cf. vult, revincit.
