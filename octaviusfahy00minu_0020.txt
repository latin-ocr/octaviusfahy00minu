4 OCTAVIUS

II. PERSONAGES OF THE DIALOGUE

MINUCIUS FELIX
(a) His szfc

We have but scanty evidence on the personal history
of Minucius Felix. We know from the Octavius that he
became a convert to Christianity‚1 having been previously
as prejudieed against the new oreed as any of his pagan
fellowmen 3² and that his work lay in the Roman eourts.3
For further testimony we have to rely mainly on early
Christian writers.

Lactantius (circ. 310), arguing against the divinity of
Saturn, refers to the reasoning of Minucius in the
Octavius ; 4 Minacias Felix eo libro qui Octavius inscribitur
sic aryummtatus cst 35 and later in the same work, lament-
ing the laok of Christian apologists‚ he speaks of Minucius
as a distinguished lawyer and regrets that he had not
devoted himself entirely to apologeties: Ea: iz's qm· milmj
noti sum Minucius Felix non ignobilis inter causidicos loci
fuit. Hm'ug liber cui Oetam-avus titulus est, declarat quam
idoneus veritatis assertor esse potuisset, si se totum ad z'd
studium cooztulz‘sset.⁶ Immediately afterwards Lactantius
refers to Tertullian and Cyprian.

St. ‹Jerome (circ. 392) also refers to Minucius as being
a distinguished lawyer at Rome and author of a work
entitled Octavius, a dialogue‚ as he describes it, between a
Christian and a pagan. He adds that a work De Fato s.
Contra Mathematicos was also ascribed to Minucius, but
considerations of style, in his opinion, precluded Minucian
authorship.⁷ In one of Jerome's epistles‚ where the Latin
