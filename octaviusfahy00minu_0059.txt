INTRODUOTION 43

by a change of ternis and construction (eg. supra 7205,
infra terram 5. 4 ; cm altera parte, eoe altero latere 14. 7);
or by using the abstract and concrete together (eg.
asseverationibus . . . peritioribus 14. 5 ; nequitia melioribus
5. 11); by a change of tense or mood (eg. timeas,
metueris 27. 8; eyisse . . . geritis 28. 53 cf. 18. 103
24. 4; 24. 5, etc.); by a choice of correlatives and
adverbs (eg. sive, sive . . , vel, vel 34. 10; nonnunquam
. interim 27. 1 ,- moch3; modo . . . plerwmque 19. 10);
and frequently variety is secured by means of inversion.
It must not be assumed that the work of Minucius is
merely the product of these various influences and that
the clement of originality is lacking. Individuality, on
the contrary, was a feature of all the African writers.¹
Minucius is a stylist‚ a conscious artist who appreciated
the value of form while rejecting the false canons of
Fronto. He tempers symmetry with variety, oratorical
fulness with brevity and concision. The result is a style
of writing fresh, picturesque, rich, harmonicus and complex.

E. OTHER FIGURES

Other figures that frequently occur in the Octavius
besides those mentioned are: Ellipsis (see under I'ronoun

Hypallage (eg. stae spectaculi voluptate 4. 13 cf. 8. 43
16. 1; 35. 3>; Conversion (eg. aut neme Christianos
philosophos esse aut philosophos faisse iam tune Christianos
20. 13 cf. 10. 53 18. 9; 22. 1; 22. 2).
