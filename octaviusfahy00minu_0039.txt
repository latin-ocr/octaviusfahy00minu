V. MANUSCRIPTS AND EDITIONS OF
THE OCTAVIUS

The Octavius has reached us through a minuscule
manuscript of the ninth century (Codex Parisinus 1661),
where it appears as the eighth book of Arnobius, Adver-
sus Nationes. A copy of the eleventh century (codem
Bruxellensz's 10847) is of no additional value for the
restoration of the text.

The editio princeps (r) was published by Sabaeus in
1543, who, however, regarded the Dialogue as the eighth
book of Arnobius. Baldwin discovered the error in
1560. Among the most notable editions are those of
Cellarius (1699), Davies (1707), Gronovius (1709),
Lindner (1760), Holden (1853), Halm (1867), Dombart
(1876, 1881), Leonard (1882), Baehrens (1886), Boenig
(1903), Waltzing (1903, 1909), Schone (1913).

The Paris MS. (Ρ) contains a number of orthographical
ermrs, omissions‚ and transpositions‚ and was considered
by earlier critics to be very corrupt. The tendency
among latter-day scholars, Schone excepted‚ has been
towards conservatism.¹

prose. The language of Plautus and Terence is pure,
but it contains forms, constructions‚ and elements peculiar
