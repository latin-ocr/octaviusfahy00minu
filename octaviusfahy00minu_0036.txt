20 OCTAVIUS

IV. MODELS AND SOURCES

The Octavius is not an original work in the same
sense as the Dialogues of Plato or Cicero. It is
modelled on the De natam deorum of Cicero who in
turn adopted the dialogue form from Plato. Many of
the ideas and instances of the Octavius are taken directly
from the works of Cicero. Caecilius is clearly the
counterpart of Cotta, sceptic and pontiff. After Cicero
Seneca is the chief source of inspiration. There were
many elements common to Christian and Stoic morals
and a truth enunciated in the formula of Seneca, apostle
of Stoicism, would win commendatior] with the educated
public who were mostly Stoic‚ without compromising the
saith of Christianity. Other Latin writers are represented
by way of reminiscence, allusion or reference, sometimes
by direct quotation or adaptation, especially Vergil,
Lucretius, Ovid‚ Horace, Juvenal, Martial, Sallust, Florus
and Lucan.

With the works of Plato, among Greek writers,
Minucius shows a distinct acquaintance. The digression
on the merits of debate in Chapter xiV., serving as a
transition between the speeches of Caecilius and Octavius,
is clearly after Plato, leedo (pp. 89, 90), being almost a
literal translation. There are allusions also to Homer,
Hesiod and Xenophon.

To previous Christian writers Minucius is indebted
for ideas and arguments. Quadratus, Aristides, Aristo,
St. Justin, Tatian, Athenagoras, Theophilus and Irenaeus
were his predecessors in the department of Apology.
They gave a currency to proofs and illustrations which
Minucius naturally adopted, but it cannot be definitely
stated that he actually used any of these authors.
