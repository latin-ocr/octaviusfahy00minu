10 OCTAVIUS

CAECILIUS

Caecilius Natalis was probably a native of Cirta
(Constantine), the capital of Numidia. Here Latin
inscriptions have been found concerning a Marcus
Caecilius Natalis, dating from 210 ΑΛ).1 This Caecilius
was chief magistrate of his native town, and in the
opinion of some he is identical with the Caecilius of the
Dialogue. An obvious difficulty, however, is the fact
that the Caecilius of the inscriptions is a pagan of
advanced years, while we know that the friend of
Minucius became a Christian after the discussion with
Octavius. Perhaps he relapsed into paganism, or it may
be that the Caecilius mentioned in the inscriptions of
Constantine was a son of the convert who renounced his
father’s religion and rose to supreme power in his native
city. Such renunciations of Christianity, we know, were
frequent in Africa in the early partos the third century.2
The latter hypothesis, it may he added, makes for the
earlier date of the Octavius. There is no further evidence
concerning Caecilius, except that at the time of the
discussion he was attached to Minucius to learn the
profession of law and eloquence.3

III. PURPOSE OF THE OCTAVIUS

Critics are exercised as to the intent and purpose of
the Octavius. Some there are who think that the author
was as yet imperfectly instructed in the doctrine of the
new religion,4 that, like Arnobius, he undertook to defend
Christianity in order to merit the favour of admission
