PREFAOE vii

In writing the notes I have received considerable
help from previous editions, especially those of Holden
and Waltzing. To the latter’s work Ι am particularly
indebted. As necessarily happens, many of the references
cited will be found already in the work of other editors.
I hope, however, to have contributed something new to
the interpretation of the text. Unfortunately Mayor's
edition of Tertullian’s Apoloqy did not reach me until
the notes were almost completed. But this disadvantage
is set off by the consideration that the limits of a school
edition, such as the present, must preclude much of the
eruditiori that an earlier acquaintance with' this great
work might have supplied.

In the interests of younger students I have emphasised
the peculiarities of later Latin in point of language and
syntax, Some attention also has been devoted in the
notes to matters of textual criticism, as I have found by
experience that when problems of this kind are referred
to an appendix they are apt to be neglected by students,
and this important branch of study suffers in consequence.

It remains for me to express a word of indebtedness
and gratitude to my colleagues Dr. Sheehan and Dr.
D'Alton, and especially to Professor Semple of Dublin
University CoHege, who has kindly read the work in
proof and made many valuable suggestions.
