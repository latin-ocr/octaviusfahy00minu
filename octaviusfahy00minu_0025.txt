INTRODUCTION 9

of the two works has led Ebert,l on the contrary, to the
opinion that Tertullian is indebted to Minucius for much
of the argument and illustration, which he developed and
impressed with the stamp of his own original genius.
According to this critic2 Minucius was immediately in-
spired by the Πρεσβεία περὶ Χριστιανῶν of Athenagoras,
a “Christian philosopher of Athens‚'' as he is described
in the title of his work, whose apology sor Christianity
against charges of atheism and immorality was addressed
to Marcus Aurelius and Commodus about the year 178.

(c) “ De Fato '²

Os the work De Fato, to which St. Jerome refers, we
know nothing further. Minucius, it is true, holds forth
a promise of a discussion on this subject,3 and it is
possible that such a work from some other pen was
ascribed to him.

OCTAVIUS

For information concerning Ianuarius Octavius we
are altogether dependent on the Dialogue. Possibly he
also hailed from Africa, where he probably lived with
his wife and family at the period of his visit to Rome.⁴
He had probably died before the date of production of
the work which bears his name.5 He had been on most
intimate terms of friendship with Minucius from his
earliest youth,6 having preceded him into the Christian
fold,7 where he was evidently a man of prominence.8
He is the champion of Christianity in the Dialogue.
