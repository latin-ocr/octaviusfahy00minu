1 14 OCTAVIUS

(Lucr. 1. 1021 ff.) Omnium semina, cf. elementa 5. 8, called by
Lucr. semina rerum, corpora prima, corpora materiae, corpuscula
primordia5 by Cic. atomi, corpuscula individua (Fin. 1. 6. 17). Cf.
Verg. E. 6. 31-34 3 Cic. Acad. 1. 6. 17 ; Ον. M. 1. 1-88.

membra: i.e. fire, air, earth and water.

machinator, “engineer''; cf. Livy 24. 34; (deus) qui haec
machinatas est (Cic. Tim. 9). In Cic.'the mean. is ‘⁶ organiser '' or
‘⁸ cont1·iver'’ with signif. of underhand methods (Cat. 3. 3. 6).

ignis: the fiery atoms that formed the stars (Luer. 5. 455-508),
not the primal element of universal fire of Heracleitus.

(Lucr. 5. 481-2); Plut. Plac. Phil. 1. 4.

*religio . . . superstitio : Servius derives reliyio fr. religare “to
bind '' (Verg. A. 8. 349); cf. Lucr. reliqionum nodos exsolvere (1. 931 ;
4. 7); Cic. De Dom. 105. Cic. derives the word fr. releyere “to
take into consideration '' (NJ). 2. 28. 72) opp. to neyleyere3 cf.
Hom. Διὸς οὐκ ἀλέγων (see Munro, Lucr. 1. 109). It is difficult
to distinguish exactly between genuine religiousness and superstitio
or erroneous excess of religion (Gk. δεισιδαιμονία). In the early
period of heathendom the religious man was one who adhered to
the legal traditions in his relation to the gods and ‘the superstitious
man, one who gave himself up to strange rites or to the worship
of strange gods. Varro held the superstitious were those who
feared the gods as enemieS, the religious those who loved them as
parents (Aug. Oz‘v. Dei, 6. 9). Of. Theophrast.‚ superstition is δειλία
πρὸς τὸ δαιμόνιον (Char. 16). Cic. gives the law against Super-
stition: separatim nemo habessit deos, ‘nec 'novos neve advenas nisi
publice adscitos: prii-atim colunto quos rite a patribus cultos acceperunt
(Leyy. 2. 19). Hence Christianity is a prava superstitio (Pliny, Ep.
10. 97); cf. exitiabilis superstitio (Tac. A. 15. 44). Α religion
becomes a superstition either by the introduction of new and
strange rites (Cic. N.D. 3. 5) or from its arousing irrational fears
(iot, ibid. 1. 117) or from its connexion with immorality (id., Clu.
194) 01· from contradicting the teaching of science (iat, Div. 2.
148); cf. Sen. clem. 2. 5; Ep. 123. 16. According to Cic„ reliyio est,
quae superioris cuiusdam naturae (quam divinam vocant) curam caere-
